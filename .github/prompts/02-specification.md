I have developed a detailed product proposal that includes technical requirements and user stories for an MVP that needs to be developed.  Please write a technical specification for this product.  This should have enough detail in it that a mid-career Azure developer that understands TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and .NET can take the technical specification and implement it within 2 months.

Use Mermaid diagrams where needed.

Use the following markdown format:

```markdown
# Technical Specification

- Aim of the project.
- Systems Overview.

## Technical Decisions

A discussion of the major decisions that had to be made, alternatives considered, and the recommendation for the decision.

## Data Model

An overview of the data model.

- Provide a per-table breakdown including the column, DB Type, .NET Type, indexing and other options, and usage of data.
- Provide a Mermaid erDiagram of the data model.
- Discuss any requirements for the data model (e.g. triggers or indices).

## API Models

A breakdown of the API endpoints that we will implement, supporting RFC 9110 conditional requests and OData
query and paging capabilities.

## UI Design

A discussion on the UI design.  Include a discussion on the basic flows that should be present in the MVP.

## Testing Design

Considerations for testing.

## Security and privacy considerations

Discuss any security and privacy considerations that are required to implement the product.
```

Please:
1. Ask me questions about any areas that need more detail.
2. Suggest features or considerations I might have missed.
3. Help me organize requirements logically
4. Show me the current state of the spec after each exchange
5. Flag any potential technical challenges or important decisions.
